How to use call by reference in c?
 The very first clue i got is to use pointers.
Why cant we use call by reference in c?
What is a pointer in c ?
 Pointers are variables whose values are memory address.From this defination i get a brief idea that pointer provides the addess 
 to access the value of the variable.
How to define a pointer?
 int *countPtr, count;
 here int is the return type *countPtr is the pointer which points to the value of the variable count.
specifies that variable 
countPtr
 is of type 
int* (i.e., a pointer to an integer) and is read (right to left), “countPtr is a pointer to  int ” or “countPtr
 points to an object of type  int .” Also, the variable countis defined to be an int, not a pointer to an int. The *applies 
only to countPtr in the definition. When * is used in this manner in a definition, it indicates
that the variable being defined is a pointer. Pointers can be defined to point to objects of
any type. To prevent the ambiguity of declaring pointer and non-pointer variables in the
same declaration as shown above, you should always declare
 only one variable per declaration. 
what is "*"?
 The unary* operator, commonly referred to as the indirection operator or dereferencing operator, returns the value
 of the object to which its operand (i.e., a pointer) points. For example, the statementprints the value of variable y,   
 namely 5. Using * in this manner is called dereferencing a pointer.
