How to use call by reference in c?
 The very first clue i got is to use pointers.
Why cant we use call by reference in c?
What is a pointer in c ?
 Pointers are variables whose values are memory address.From this defination i get a brief idea that pointer provides the addess 
 to access the value of the variable.
How to define a pointer?
 int *countPtr, count;
 here int is the return type *countPtr is the pointer which points to the value of the variable count.
specifies that variable 
countPtr
 is of type 
int
*
 (i.e., a pointer to an integer) and is read
(right to left), “
countPtr
 is a pointer to 
int
” or “
countPtr
 points to an object of type 
int
.”
Also, the variable 
count
 is defined to be an 
int
, 
not
 a pointer to an 
int
. The 
*
 applies 
only
to 
countPtr
 in the definition. When 
*
 is used in this manner in a definition, it indicates
that the variable being defined is a pointer. Pointers can be defined to point to objects of
any type. To prevent the ambiguity of declaring pointer and non-pointer variables in the
same declaration as shown above, you should always declare
 only one variable per declara-
tion.
