To add n fractions we need arrays and structures....
In combination we need array of structures!!
So what is array of structures??
  -Structure is collection of different data type. An object of structure represents a single record in memory, 
  if we want more than one record of structure type, we have to create an array of structure or object. As we know, 
  an array is a collection of similar type, therefore an array can be of structure type.
  
  What is the syntax of array of structures??
    -syntax for declaring structure array


              struct struct-name
              {
                     datatype var1;
                     datatype var2;
                     - - - - - - - - - -
                     - - - - - - - - - -
                     datatype varN;
              };

              struct struct-name obj [ size ];
